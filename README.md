# stock-trend-prediction-repo
Stock trend prediction using XGBoost

The libraries used in this project are: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy and sklearn.

The goal of this project is to provide an example of how to predict the market states of a particular stock, in our case, the SP500.

This repo only contains a jupyter notebook called stock_trend_prediction. It addresses the following questions:

1) How to evaluate machine learning models on time series data
2) How can I deal with random variation and noise from price data?
3) Which information can I use to predict market sates?
